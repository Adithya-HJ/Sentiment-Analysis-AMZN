This is a project that aims to classify text i.e we do sentiment analysis here. Sentiment analysis gives us a very short summary that is the emotion of the text.
The dataset we used in this project can be found here http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Kindle_Store_5.json.gz

There are many other datasets you can try on the same site http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon
We used LSTM's in our model you can change the model to your liking.
Details on how to replicate this will be updated shortly.
